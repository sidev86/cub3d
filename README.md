<h1>cub3D</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

cub3D is a project inspired by the iconic video game Wolfenstein 3D. The goal is to recreate a similar scenario, featuring a realistic 3D representation of a maze from a first-person perspective. This is achieved using ray-casting techniques and the MiniLibX graphics library (a small graphics library, developed by 42). The project includes textured walls, customizable floor and ceiling colors, and smooth navigation, offering an immersive experience.
